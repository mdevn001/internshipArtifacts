Developing automated algorithms to optimize productivity for open cast mining Load Haul Dump cycles:

 

Problem background: In mining, haulage accounts to 60% of the total operating cost. The objective is to optimize haulage costs while increasing overall equipment effectiveness.

To accomplish this, the haul cycle is decomposed into discrete events to model the operator behavior and  equipment failure modes. This model is overlaid this with contextual  information like weather, road conditions, intersections and elevation to understand the factors that contribute the variations. Interventions are designed to mitigate the impact of these factors.

 

Solution:

·       Performed exploratory data analysis of mining production data to understand and uncover the causative factors that impede optimum mining productivity.

·       Implemented time series based unsupervised machine learning techniques on haul cycles to convert continuous variations into discrete events in order to model the operator behavior and  equipment failure modes.

·       Applied machine learning algorithms to identify performance characteristics of operators that are constraining productivity

·       Performed statistical analysis and identified factors that mitigate effective utilization of the assets, such as frequent breakdowns, unplanned maintenance and premature standbys.

·       Derived statistical models to optimize haulage costs while increasing overall mining equipment effectiveness.

 

Qualitative Outcomes:

·       Unsupervised Learning and Pattern Analysis of LHD events that have resulted in actionable insights such as excessive dumping durations correlate with poor truck control while reversing

·       Behavior profiling of operators to identify the top and bottom performing operators and identify differences in their behaviors such as idling, aggressive braking, cornering, speeding, off duty cycles, etc.

·       Demonstrated business value to the customer where the entire haul cycle can be optimized by following best practices and actionable insights obtained from our analysis. Shift and dump location elevations seem to have an effect on the variability of dumping durations

 

Quantitative outcomes:        

·       Bottom 10 operators contribute to ~15% of excessive dump durations. Interventions designed to improve outcomes

·       In a fleet of 30 trucks, derived projected savings of approximately 82 truck days every month.

·       Operating Improvement of 1%

·       Projected $8.5M Net Return over 5 years
